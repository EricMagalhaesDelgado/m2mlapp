Conversion from .M to .MLAPP (Matlab files)

M2MLAPP provides the conversion from .M to .MLAPP, enabling GitHub text line based control, and allowing the reconstruction of apps whose .MLAPP files are damaged.

### Syntax:

    mlappFullPath = m2mlapp(mFileFullPath, varargin);

### Arguments:
* mFileFullPath must be a `scalar text (char | string)` with the fullpath to the .M file.

### Optional Name-Parameters Arguments:
(argument name, type, and default value)
* **Name** `scalar text (char | string)` = ClassName
* **Author** `scalar text (char | string)` = ''
* **Version** `scalar text (char | string)` = '1.0'
* **Summary** `scalar text (char | string)` = ''
* **Description** `scalar text (char | string)` = 'App code generated by m2mlapp.'
* **Screenshot** `logical` = true
* **OpenApp** `logical` = true

### Notes:
**(a)** The images referenced in the app (icon figure, uiimage, uibutton) must be in the Matlab search path during the execution of the m2mlapp function.

**(b)** After validating the input arguments, the function will return the name of the .MLAPP file, or in case of a parser error, it will return an empty output.

**(c)** A class loaded in the AppDesigner environment has a fixed structure, which limits customizations. In this structure, the first section is the declaration of components (according to their stacking order); then there are editable sections (properties, methods, and callbacks); and finally, the methods for creating components, and construct or delete the app.

### Examples:
Example 1 - Basic convertion (.M >> .MLAPP)

    m2mlapp('C:\GitProject\winMain.m', 'Author', 'Eric MagalhÃ£es Delgado', 'Version', '1.01');

Example 2 - Rebuilding a broken .MLAPP file (.MLAPP >> .M >> .MLAPP)

    mlappFileFullPath  = 'C:\GitProject\winMain.mlapp';
    [mPath, mFilename] = fileparts(mlappFileFullPath)
    mFileFullPath      = fullfile(mPath, [mFilename '.m'])
    
    matlabCode = util.extractMATFile(mlappFileFullPath)
    writematrix(matlabCode, mFileFullPath, 'FileType', 'text', 'QuoteStrings', false)
    
    movefile(mlappFileFullPath, fullfile(mPath, [mFilename '_old.mlapp']))
    m2mlapp(mFileFullPath)
